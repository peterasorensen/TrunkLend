# TrunkLend

## Earn money by renting your things - without having to meet face-to-face. 

TrunkLend is your automated lending service machine that operates straight out of the back of your trunk.

Lend things you own. Rent the things you want. Store your own things in the back of your trunk and earn money by renting them out. 
TrunkLend works by installing a mounted automation system and security system directly in your trunk. Lenders are protected from theft by requiring users of TrunkLend to have a credit card on file.
The security system includes a vehicle camera and owner alarm notifying system. Any unauthorized access to other parts of the car using the TrunkLend app will result in a user's automatic termination from the service, card charges equivalent to damages and lost goods, and a fine.

Installation delivery and returns available 7:30AM to 8:30PM, 7 days a week during local trial.
